# TLTE C.I.C. · Open Source Policy

TLTE C.I.C. publishes selected components of its digital ecosystem as
open-source to promote transparency, collaboration, and community-focused
innovation. This policy defines what is made public, how it may be used,
and which parts of our infrastructure remain private.

---

## 🌐 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:

- Provide clear guidance on which modules are open-source.
- Establish boundaries between public components and secure systems.
- Enable developers to collaborate without exposing sensitive infrastructure.
- Support the global Tamil community through transparent, ethical technology.

---

## 🔓 2. What Is Open Source

Only the following types of components may be open-source:

- Public utilities  
- Developer tools  
- Shared libraries  
- UI/UX experiments  
- Non-sensitive documentation  
- Community-facing modules  
- Framework-level structures  
- Educational or research-helping code  

These components are published under the **MIT License**, unless otherwise stated.

## 🔒 3. What Remains Private

The following MUST remain private and will **never** appear in open repositories:

- Core infrastructure of TLTE C.I.C.  
- Identity verification systems  
- Access-control logic  
- Operational architecture  
- Internal communication systems  
- Governance-related software  
- Security-sensitive modules  
- Any tooling used for critical decision-making  
- Proprietary research

## ⚖️ 4. Licensing

All open-source components released by TLTE C.I.C. use:

**MIT License**  
(See the `LICENSE` file in each repository.)

Users are free to:

- use

## 🤝 5. Contributions

External contributions are welcome when:

- They follow the repository’s guidelines.

- They do not conflict with internal policies.

A future `CONTRIBUTING.md` will expand on contribution rules.

## 🛡️ 6. Reporting Security Concerns

If you discover a vulnerability in a public module:

**Do NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, privately contact:

📧 **security@tlte.cloud**  
(If this email is not yet active, use **info@tlte.cloud**.)

Reports are reviewed under TLTE C.I.C.’s internal security workflow.

---

## 📁 7. Repository Transparency

Each repository will clearly indicate:

- What is open-source  
- What remains private  
- Which parts are safe to contribute to  
- Any boundaries developers should be aware of  

This ensures clarity for external contributors and protects internal systems.

---

## 📜 8. Policy Updates

This policy may be updated as:

- TLTE C.I.C. expands  
- New systems are developed  
- Additional public modules are released  
- Security requirements evolve  

Updates will be published directly to this file.
