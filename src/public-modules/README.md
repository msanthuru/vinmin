# public-modules/

This directory contains modules that are intentionally designed for public use
within the VinMin project under TLTE C.I.C. Code placed here should be
safe, reusable, and appropriate for open-source release.

Modules placed in this folder MUST be:

- non-sensitive  
- fully public-friendly  
- free of internal TLTE C.I.C. logic  
- unrelated to identity or authentication  
- not linked to operational infrastructure  
- suitable for external developers to use or extend  

Examples of what may appear here:

- utility packages  
- helper libraries  
- safe public-facing features  
- shared components  
- template modules  

Sensitive, private, or strategic systems cannot be placed here and remain
strictly within private TLTE C.I.C. repositories.
